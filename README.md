# nvim-threeway

## Suggested mappings

```
nnoremap <leader>- :Threeway<CR>
```

## TODO

- Ensure that when you start, or when you change directory, that the cursor is on the expected line
- Listen for line change instead of hijacking j and k
- Debounce requests when moving up and down
- Fix things breaking when opening from a directory instead of a file
